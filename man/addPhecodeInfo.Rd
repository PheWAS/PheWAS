\title{Add phecode descriptions and group information to existing data.}
\usage{
addPhecodeInfo(
  data,
  descriptions = T,
  groups = T,
  groupnums = F,
  groupcolors = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing the a column with phecodes. Can
additionally be a character vector of phecodes. See details for requirements.}

\item{descriptions}{Add the phecode descriptions? Default is TRUE (yes).}

\item{groups}{Add the phecode group names? Default is TRUE (yes).}

\item{groupnums}{dd the phecode group numbers? Default is FALSE (no). Used in
plotting}

\item{groupcolors}{Add the phecode group colors? Default is FALSE (no). Used
in plotting}
}
\value{
Data frame with added columns:
\item{description}{The description of the phecode.}
\item{group}{The name of the phecode group.}
\item{groupnum}{The assigned number of the phecode group.}
\item{color}{The default plotting color of the phecode group.}
}
\description{
\code{addPhecodeInfo} adds the phecode description and group information,
found in the data frame \code{pheinfo}. Requires the full three digit
phecodes in character format. This function replaces addPhewasDescription
and addPhewasGroups.
}
\details{
This function provides a quick way to add phecode descriptions and group
names.
It will select the first column matching any of "phecode", "phewas" or
"pheno" to merge on. If none is identified, it reports a warning and attempts
the merge with the first column.
Phecodes must be character vectors, otherwise they may have inaccurate
mappings. If PheWAS codes are factors it will convert them to characters,
≥≤give a warning, and attempt to map them.
If a character (or factor) variable or vector is passed in, it will return
code descriptions for those codes.
